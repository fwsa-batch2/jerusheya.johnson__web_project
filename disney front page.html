<h1>Types of Disney world characters</h1>

         At the Disney World theme parks and resorts, you’ll find 
         two types of characters: face characters and fur characters.
         Face characters take on a fully-human form and look like real people, 
         complete with wigs and makeup, while fur characters have a 
         mascot-style costume with oversized heads. Face characters include 
         all of the Disney princesses and princes, as well as live-action 
         characters including Jack Sparrow and Mary Poppins — just to name a few.
         Fur characters are typically animal or nonhuman characters, such as
         Disney’s Fab Five, the Toy Story gang and Chewbacca. 
         But there are some "human" fur characters, most notably the Incredible 
         family and Carl and Russell from "Up." Pretty self-explanatory, right?

            The traditional meet-and-greet is by far the most personal way to 
            interact with Disney World characters. Even though it only lasts for a few moments, 
            the character has all of their attention on you.Plus, you get the best photo-op
            whether you use your own camera or the Disney PhotoPass service. Since you’ll be 
            taking lots of pictures, get creative with poses. Pretend you’re surfing with Stitch or 
            shooting an arrow with Merida. With the new indoor character sightings, guests can get
            personalized interactions again.Even though there is distance, the characters do a great 
            job of having those individual conversations. Remember that masks are currently required
             indoors and must stay on at all times, even for photos.

            For a large selection of characters in one stop, it’s worth considering a character dining experience. 
            These meals offer you a slight time advantage. Why wait 45 minutes for 
            one character when the same amount of time at a character meal could get you multiple greeting opportunities? 
            Plus you have mealtime covered, and for some spots, you don’t even have to leave your resort if you’re staying on-site!

            The downside is the price tag, which is definitely more than counter-service dining. 
            Your time with the characters is also limited. With 40+ tables to cover, they can't linger with you for too long. 
            Some character dining locations are not currently offering characters, while others have distanced ones.

            For the First Time in Forever: A Frozen Sing-Along Celebration at Disney's Hollywood
            Studios —It’s time to belt out "Let It Go!" The Royal Historians of Arendelle recount the story of their
            kingdom with a little bit of help from Anna, Kristoff and Elsa. (Even Olaf makes a special 
            appearance during the holiday season!)
            Beauty and the Beast — Live on Stage also at Disney's Hollywood Studios takes you through a tale as old as time. 
            This Broadway-style show takes you through Belle's iconic story, with plenty of musical fun!
             Although the show is marked a little differently now due to social distancing, we are so hoppy to see this musical again.

 <h1>Tips to interact with Disney Characters</h1>

          It can be tempting to leap at the first sign of a Disney character your little one needs to see. 
          Many people will stop and see the characters when they first pass by earlier in the day, causing long lines. 
          For those characters who have all-day meeting times (i.e. Mickey Mouse and the princesses at Magic Kingdom), 
          consider waiting until later in the afternoon or evening. By waiting until later, fewer people are passing 
          these areas for the first time and are more apt to carry on with their magical day.If there’s a character 
          you want to see and you know where the meeting place and time will be, line up before the character arrives. 
          Nothing draws a crowd (and a line) at Disney like a character. Arriving a few minutes early and hanging around or
          waiting in line before the character appears can save you time later. This worked well for us when we met Alice at the United
          Kingdom pavilion in EPCOT. The fact that Mary Poppins was still out nearby helped to further draw people away from the Alice meeting spot.
